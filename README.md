Task to test consumers/producers in Android

## Test-Project

Create a simple Android-App which shows a list and two buttons below the list ordered horizontal.
Clicking the left button creates a new producer.
Clicking the right button creates a new consumer.

A producer adds every 3 seconds a new item to the list.
A consumer removes every 4 seconds an item from the list.
A created producer/consumer will never be removed and will do its job forever.

The user can create producer or consumer how often he wants by clicking the specified buttons.

For this project use Android Studio and Java.
Use suitable ui elements to display the Buttons and List.
